# Statistical Analysis - Final project

The aim of the project is to carry out an analysis of Mexico's poor air quality based on the mediation of temperatures and the main pollutants present in the atmosphere (2011-2022 data) and subsequently create a model to forecast the temperature and pollutants in the coming years and propose solutions to this problem.

For the resolution of this task we used two computer tools, Excel and Minitab. Applying the knowledge acquired during the course, such as population and sample sets, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, probability, regression and correlation, hypothesis testing.

Specifically for this dataset we use a Sine Function -> *(𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝐵(𝑥 + 𝐶)) + 𝐷)* for the model in order to predict the data for the next years
