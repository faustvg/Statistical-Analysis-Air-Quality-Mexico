Statistical Analysis project

The project aim is to make an analysis of the bad air quality of Mexico based on the mediation of the temperatures and the principal contaminants presents in the atmosphere (data 2011-2022) and then create a model in order to forecast the temperature and the contaminants in the next years and propose solutions for this problematic

For solving this task we use two software tools, Excel and Minitab. Applying the knowledge adquired during the course, such as population and sample sets, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, probability, regression and correlation, hypothesis testing.

Specifically for this data set we use a Senoidal Function(𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝐵(𝑥 + 𝐶)) + 𝐷) in order to predict the data for the next years
